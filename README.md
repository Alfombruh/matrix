# TODO
- Search for info about "fused multiply-add function"
- Funny
    -Triangle inequality
    -Hölder norms
    -Minkowski inequality
    -Frobenius norm

# Disclaimer
Some of the prototypes of functions or mains given by the subject sheet are wrong and I've fix them. 

# Preamble
In this project we are gonna be working with matrixes and vectors in Rust. So before dwelve deeper into these concepts, we first have to understand what they are and how Im representing them.</br>
## First thing to understand is what is a Vector? </br>
To first understand this concept we have to place ourselves in a 2 dimensional space, a 2 dimensional grid. </br>
In this 2D space we have 2 main axis, te X and the Y axis, X being the horizontal one and y the vertical one (they are perpendicular). I'm supposing that we can all draw a line a write numbers in there so we are jumping to the 2D version of that.</br>
</br>
By using those 2 axis you can represent any point thats inside of that space by saying where it is on the X and Y axis. 
![Points](/assets/00_points.png)</br>
Well thats cool and all but we were here to understand what a vector is. The difference between a Vector and a Point is not that big, at least when it comes to representing them.</br>
A Vector is a point connected to the origin by a line, or if you prefer it this way, a line that goes from the origin to a point (The origin being the point (0,0)).</br>
It is defined by 2 characteristics:
- Direction: This would be the line in which this vector is drawn and in which direction it is pointing
- Magnitude/Module: The size of the vector. In terms of "lines" how long is the line

![Points](/assets/01_vectors.png)</br>

## Ok then whats a matrix? </br>

When it comes to explaining what a matrix is it is not that difficult to understand. A matrix a mathematical object used to store values in a rectangular array/table.</br>

## How Im representing them?
I've quickly explained what a Vector and a Matrix are but I havent gotten into planes, vector spaces...</br>
To quickly explain this. We can define a plane as a 2D space, like the X/Y axis.</br>
If we were to speak of a 3D vector, we would be talking about 3 axis (X/Y/Z). X, Y and Z are perpendicular and make a plane between each other.</br>
What I just explained can happend is not just fixed to 3 diomensions. So technically a vector can have N elements, N being the amount of dimensions it is represented in.</br>
</br>
So taking this into consideration we can represent a vector as an N sized array and a Matrix as N sized N sized arrays, aka and array and a double array.</br>
In Rust language:</br>
``````
pub struct Vector {
    pub array: Vec<f32>,
}
pub struct Matrix {
    pub array: Vec<Vec<f32>>,
}
``````
I would recommend making a couple methods first to interact with the data.
- Push: To add new elements to the array
- Remove: To remove the last element of the array
- Size: To get the size of the array
- from: To create that class
- Print: To print the array (this is achieved by an implementation)
- Clone: This will come in handy. You can also write this on top of the struct <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> in order to have the compiler provide you a basic a clone implementation.
