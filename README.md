# Preamble  <a name="preamble"></a>
In this project we are gonna be working with matrixes and vectors in Rust. So before dwelve deeper into these concepts, we first have to understand what they are and how Im representing them.</br>

## First thing to understand is what is a Vector?<a name="whatisavector"></a></br>
To first understand this concept we have to place ourselves in a 2 dimensional space, a 2 dimensional grid. </br>
In this 2D space we have 2 main axis, te X and the Y axis, X being the horizontal one and y the vertical one (they are perpendicular). I'm supposing that we can all draw a line a write numbers in there so we are jumping to the 2D version of that.</br>
</br>
By using those 2 axis you can represent any point thats inside of that space by saying where it is on the X and Y axis. 
![Points](/assets/00_points.png)</br>
Well thats cool and all but we were here to understand what a vector is. The difference between a Vector and a Point is not that big, at least when it comes to representing them.</br>
A Vector is a point connected to the origin by a line, or if you prefer it this way, a line that goes from the origin to a point (The origin being the point (0,0)).</br>
It is defined by 2 characteristics:
- Direction: This would be the line in which this vector is drawn and in which direction it is pointing
- Magnitude/Module: The size of the vector. In terms of "lines" how long is the line

## Ok then whats a matrix?<a name="whatsamatrix"></a></br>

When it comes to explaining what a matrix is it is not that difficult to understand. A matrix a mathematical object used to store values in a rectangular array/table.</br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/MatrixLabelled.svg/2880px-MatrixLabelled.svg.png" alt="Wikipedia Matrix" width="400px">

## How Im representing them?<a name="represent"></a>
I've quickly explained what a Vector and a Matrix are but I havent gotten into planes, vector spaces...</br>To quickly explain this. We can define a plane as a 2D space, like the X/Y axis.</br>If we were to speak of a 3D vector, we would be talking about 3 axis (X/Y/Z). X, Y and Z are perpendicular and make a plane between each other.</br>What I just explained can happend is not just fixed to 3 diomensions. So technically a vector can have N elements, N being the amount of dimensions it is represented in.</br></br>So taking this into consideration we can represent a vector as an N sized array and a Matrix as N sized N sized arrays, aka and array and a double array.</br>
In Rust language:</br>
``````
pub struct Vector {
    pub array: Vec<f32>,
}
pub struct Matrix {
    pub array: Vec<Vec<f32>>,
}
``````
I would recommend making a couple methods first to interact with the data.
- Push: To add new elements to the array
- Remove: To remove the last element of the array
- Size: To get the size of the array
- from: To create that class
- Print: To print the array (this is achieved by an implementation)
- Clone: This will come in handy. You can also write this on top of the struct <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> in order to have the compiler provide you a basic a clone implementation.</br>

# ex00 - Add, Subtract and Scale<a name="ex00"></a>
Basic operations with vectors are pretty easy, you can probably guess how they are done. But lets get into them, to really understand how to perform these operations.</br>
## Adding and Subtracting two vectors<a name="vectoraddsub"></a>
Lets declare two generic vectors  $\overline{u}=(u_{x}, u_{y}, u_{z})$ & $\overline{v}=(v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z})$</br>
Adding them would be as easy as adding each $\overline{u}$ component with each $\overline{v}$ componet. It would be something like this:</br>
$\overline{u} + \overline{v} = ([u_{x} + v_{x}], [u_{x} + v_{x}], [u_{x} + v_{x}])$</br>
The addition of two vector gives out another new one $\overline{w}$ ($\overline{w}=\overline{u}+\overline{v}$)</br>Subtracting them would be the same but chaging the $+$ for a $-$.</br>Now lets see how these 2 basic operations look on a coordinate system:</br>
### Base case

### Adding 2 vectors
<img src="./assets/00_add.png" alt="Vector Add" width="600px"></br>
### Subtracting 2 vectors

<img src="./assets/00_subfinal.png" alt="Vector Sub1" width="600px"></br>
## Scaling a vector<a name="vectorscale"></a>
Now when it comes to scaling a vector, we can visualize it as "making the arrow larger".</br>
So if we had $\overline{u}=(1,2,3)$ and we wanted to scale it by $2$ we would just do this: $\overline{u} * 2 = (1 * 2, 2 * 2, 3 * 2) = (2, 4, 6)$</br>

# ex01 - Linear combination<a name="ex01"></a>

A linear cobination if a way of adding vectors to get a new one (still inside of the same vectorial space).</br>
So in order to get a linear combination you have to multiply each vector with a scalar (scalar is the noun used to refer to numbers that are not vectors) and then add them all together. It would be something like this:</br>

$\alpha\overline{u} + \beta\overline{v} + \lambda\overline{w} = (\alpha u_{1}, \alpha u_{2}, \alpha u_{3}) + (\beta v_{1}, \beta v_{2}, \beta v_{3}) + (\lambda w_{1}, \lambda w_{2}, \lambda w_{3})$</br>
$\alpha\overline{u} + \beta\overline{v} + \lambda\overline{w} =(\alpha u_{1} + \beta v_{1} + \lambda w_{1},\alpha u_{2} + \beta v_{2} + \lambda w_{2}, \alpha u_{3} + \beta v_{3} + \lambda w_{3})$</br>

The result of the operation is a new vector.
